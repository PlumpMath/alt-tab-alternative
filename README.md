# alt-tab-alternative
Use alt-q to cycle between a selected set of windows (Native Windows alt-tab forces you to either cycle between two windows or all of them). Build with WPF, C#, and lots of Win32 interop code

Much of the Win32 interop code was cobbled together from several Stack Overflow posts. But hey, that's what programming sometimes is nowadays, right?
