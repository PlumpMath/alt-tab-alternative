# alt-tab-alternative
Use alt-q to cycle between a selected set of windows (alt-tab forces you to either cycle between two windows or all of them). Built with WPF, with lots of win32 interop code.

Much of the win32 interop code was cobbled together from several Stack Overflow posts. But hey, that's what programming nowadays sometimes is, right?
